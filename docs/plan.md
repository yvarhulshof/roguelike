# High-Level Project Plan

This document outlines the high-level steps for creating a browser-based game inspired by **Realm of the Mad God** using **Phaser**.

## 1. Project Setup

- **Framework**: Use Phaser for rendering and game logic.
- **Directory Structure**:
  - `client/` – browser code (Phaser, assets, UI).
  - `server/` – Node.js server handling multiplayer logic.
  - `docs/` – documentation and planning notes.
- **Build/Tooling**: Consider bundlers like Vite or Webpack for the client. Use npm scripts for building and running.
- **Version Control**: All code stored in this Git repository.

## 2. Core Gameplay Prototype

- Implement a single arena map.
- Add player character with basic movement and shooting controls.
- Spawn a few enemy types with simple AI (e.g., follow player, shoot projectiles).
- Use placeholder graphics for early iterations.

## 3. Multiplayer Foundations

- Set up a Node.js WebSocket server to manage player sessions.
- Server maintains authoritative state (positions, health, enemy spawns).
- Exchange messages for movement, attacks, and game events between client and server.

## 4. Expanding Features

- Add RPG elements: leveling, experience, equipment.
- Create additional maps or dungeons with increasing difficulty.
- Include cooperative mechanics (e.g., group bosses) as development progresses.

## 5. Testing & Deployment

- Host the client via a static site (e.g., GitHub Pages).
- Deploy server to a small cloud instance or container.
- Continuously test the multiplayer experience with friends and gather feedback.
