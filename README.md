# Phaser Roguelike Experiment

This repository contains a small hobby project: a browser-based game inspired by *Realm of the Mad God*. It uses **Phaser** for rendering and aims to keep hosting costs at zero. The client can be served via free static hosting (such as GitHub Pages), and any multiplayer server is optional and can run locally.

See [docs/plan.md](docs/plan.md) for the high-level development plan.
